# **Flight Ticket Price and Airline Revenue Forecasting for 2025**  
*Using Historical Data (2000-2024)*  


## **Project Description**  
This project aims to **forecast airline revenue** and **average ticket fares** for 2025 using historical data from **2000 to 2024**. The dataset includes information on **domestic and international airline revenue** as well as **average and inflation-adjusted ticket fares** across various U.S. airports.  

This analysis will help:  
âœ… **Understand revenue trends** in the airline industry.  
âœ… **Predict price fluctuations** based on historical patterns.  
âœ… **Assess the impact of external factors** such as economic recessions, pandemics, and geopolitical events.
