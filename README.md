1. Project Title:
Flight Ticket Price and Airline Revenue Forecasting for 2025 using Historical Data (2000-2024)

2. Project Description:
This project aims to forecast airline revenue and average ticket fares for 2025 using historical data from 2000 to 2024. The dataset includes information on domestic and international airline revenue as well as average and inflation-adjusted ticket fares across various U.S. airports. The forecasting models will help analyze revenue trends, price fluctuations, and the impact of external factors such as economic recessions, pandemics, and geopolitical events.
