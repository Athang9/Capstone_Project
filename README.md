## 📈 Project Overview

The U.S. airline industry has been tested by multiple major disruptions over the last two decades — from the 2008 global financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
**Turbulence & Triumph** is a comprehensive, data-driven study analyzing **20 years** of operational and financial data across major U.S. airlines, uncovering patterns of **market volatility**, **financial resilience**, and **recovery strategies** among Legacy, Low-Cost, and Regional carriers.

Key questions addressed:
- How did different types of airlines respond to financial crises?
- Which business models proved most resilient?
- How did operational volatility and financial health evolve over time?

## 🛠️ Techniques and Tools Used

- **K-Means Clustering** for business model classification
- **Time-Series Trend Analysis** on passenger volumes, market share, financial metrics
- **Market Share Volatility Calculation** using moving standard deviation
- **Composite Resilience Scoring** (custom-developed)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Power BI
- **Data Sources**: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), DOT Form 41, SEC Filings

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Low-Cost carriers** rapidly expanded post-2008, gaining substantial market share but suffered higher operational volatility during COVID-19.
- **Legacy carriers** demonstrated stronger financial resilience due to diversified operations, alliances, and government support mechanisms.
- **Regional carriers** were disproportionately affected during both crises, showing higher market share instability and slower financial recovery.
- **Operational agility** combined with **financial discipline** emerged as the defining traits of resilient airlines.
