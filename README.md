# Turbulence & Triumph: Analyzing Market Volatility and Financial Resilience in the U.S. Airline Industry (2003–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes two decades of U.S. airline industry data (2003–2023) to assess market volatility and financial resilience across major economic crises — the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using clustering, trend analysis, volatility computation, and resilience scoring, this study identifies patterns of operational and financial recovery across Legacy, Low-Cost, and Regional carriers.

## Repository Structure
- `/report/` — Final capstone report (PDF and LaTeX source).
- `/data/` — Processed datasets used for analysis (samples only).
- `/notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for data processing, clustering, trend analysis, and resilience scoring.
- `/figures/` — Visualizations generated from the analyses.
- `/dashboard/` — Power BI dashboard screenshots and overview.
- `requirements.txt` — Python libraries used for the analysis.

## Key Techniques
- K-Means Clustering
- Time-Series Trend Analysis
- Volatility Measurement
- Composite Resilience Scoring
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Power BI

## Results Highlights
- Low-Cost carriers gained significant market share post-2008 but showed higher volatility during COVID-19.
- Legacy carriers recovered financial stability faster due to diversified operations and government support.
- Regional carriers remained the most vulnerable throughout both crises.

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes the key metrics. (See `/dashboard/` folder for screenshots and overview.)
